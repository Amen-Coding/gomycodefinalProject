            <h1>History of Football</h1>
            <p>Modern football originated in Britain in the 19th century. The game evolved from earlier "folk football" games played in towns and villages, adapting to urbanization and the rise of public schools like Winchester, Charterhouse, and Eton College. By 1863, the Football Association (FA) established rules that prohibited handling the ball except for goalkeepers, shaping the game into what we know today.</p>
